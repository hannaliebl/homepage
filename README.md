# A New Homepage #

I have seen the way of the portfolio and blog site, and it is made up of simple HTML files. This is an ongoing process to re-design and re-implement [hannaliebl.com](http://www.hannaliebl.com) into a statically-generated site.

At present it uses [Harp.js](http://harpjs.com/) to compile and serve everything, including SCSS files, Jade templates, and Markdown files.

I am not using Bootstrap or anything because I like writing my own CSS systems... This site will use mobile-first responsive web design.
