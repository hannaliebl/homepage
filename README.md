# A New Homepage #

I have seen the way of the portfolio and blog site, and it is made up of simple HTML files. This is an ongoing process to re-design and re-implement hannaliebl.com into a statically-generated site.

At present it uses [Harp.js](http://harpjs.com/) to compile everything, including SCSS files, Jade templates, and Markdown files.
